Directory
=========

- slightly directory inspired by [X.500](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500)

- meta data for each stored object
- schema for the hierarchy can be provided
- due to the distributed persistence layer it is not a service (with a server)
- rather it provides search and  hierarchical access
- since our graph DB is not directed and can have loops, there maybe multiple paths to the same object
