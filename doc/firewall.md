Firewall
========

@see also evolux.everblack/firewall.md

Since we can't trust data coming from other peers, we need a firewall to 
- defend spam attacks, which probably fills up your local DB
- reject invalid data
    - wrong signature
    - wrong formats
    - too large (refers to spam)

## Blacklists

Block hashes/addresses from matter (gun,ipfs,ethereum,...)

## Repositories

Block repository entries, keys (signatures)
(Software) components loaded are always under control of the device owner (identity)
