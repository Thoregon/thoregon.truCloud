Components
==========

Don't bloatware. 
import finegrain
don't import huge modules for just one function

- mapping module/component to location
- each app supplies its own mapping
    - like package.lock with refernces to the used versions
- management
    - version updates
    
- extends evolux.dyncomponents by metadata
    - specify API
    - how it can be instantiated from matter (encrypted storage)
